Step 2: Develop an ER Model
ER Model Description
The provided Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is designed to represent and organize a comprehensive dataset comprising Country Statistics, Economy, Health, Education, and Employment indicators. The primary objective of this model is to understand relationships between different entities and facilitate further analytics.
