The selected 35 indicators provide insights into global trends in health, economic development, education, sustainability, and demographics. Key health indicators, like access to electricity and fertility rates, reflect their impact on public health and infrastructure, while economic measures, such as GDP growth and foreign direct investment, show how financial prosperity influences resources like healthcare and education. Employment trends highlight economic structures and gender dynamics, and education and technology metrics, like broadband access, emphasize the role of digital tools in fostering innovation and opportunity. Energy and trade indicators connect development with sustainability and globalization, while demographic metrics, such as urban population and growth rates, reveal infrastructure and resource pressures. These indicators were chosen for their relevance, wide data coverage, and ability to uncover interconnections among health, economy, and society.

The provided data descriptions encompass critical metrics related to education, employment, and literacy, offering valuable insights into societal development and economic stability. By analyzing variables such as enrollment rates, educational attainment, literacy levels, and labor force participation, we can identify patterns of inequality, forecast future trends, and assess the impact of education on employment outcomes. Predictive analytics will help determine the factors influencing school dropouts, unemployment, and literacy gaps, while descriptive analysis will reveal existing disparities between genders and education levels. Ultimately, this research aims to inform policies that enhance educational access, reduce unemployment, and promote economic growth.
